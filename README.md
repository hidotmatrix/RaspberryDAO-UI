## Solulab DAO(Decentralised Automnomous Organisation)
Solulab DAO is an ERC20 based governance mechanism.

DAOs are an effective and safe way to work with like-minded folks around the globe.

Think of them like an internet-native business that's collectively owned and managed by its members. They have built-in treasuries that no one has the authority to access without the approval of the group. Decisions are governed by proposals and voting to ensure everyone in the organization has a voice. [Read More About DAOs](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/)

### Smart contract structure
This repository uses openzeppelin's modular system of governance

- [Governance](https://github.com/akashSolulab/Solulab-DAO/blob/main/contracts/Governance.sol): The core contract that contains all the logic and primitives
- [Timelock](https://github.com/akashSolulab/Solulab-DAO/blob/main/contracts/Timelock.sol): Allows multiple proposers and executors, in addition to the Governor itself.
- [Governance Token](https://github.com/akashSolulab/Solulab-DAO/blob/main/contracts/Token.sol): Extension of ERC20 to support Compound-like voting and delegation
- [Treasury](https://github.com/akashSolulab/Solulab-DAO/blob/main/contracts/Treasury.sol): Contract holding the funds inside it

##### Deploying GTP Token Smart Contract
```bash
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy-governance.js
```
#### Smart contract verification
Add the following to your .env file
> `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY = ""`
